          WHAT IS TRANSHUMANISM?</h1>

          “Cyborg” is the contraction of “cybernetic organism”, a term coined in the 1960s by two New York researchers: 
          Manfred Clynes and Nathan S. Kline. It designates the hybridity of a biological organism linked to prostheses. The cyborg is a human 
          grafted with mechanics, electronics. Pop culture is filled with examples of cyborgs: Inspector Gadget, Alita, Iron Man, Darth Vader, 
          Edward Scissorhands… The robot differs from the cyborg in that it is an entirely artificial assembly.

        In the 17th century, Ambroise Paré, a surgeon specializing in war wounds, used a wooden sleeve as a prosthesis. Today, it is possible to 
        connect the prosthesis to the nervous system. Another technology: exoskeletons, which are articulated and motorized equipment, attached 
        to certain parts of the body to increase their capacities. Finally, there are implants: artificial devices integrated inside the body that 
        can compensate for a deficient or amputated organ.

        In the United States, 42% of healthcare facilities perform preimplantation diagnosis. This expensive process but available on request allows 
        you to choose the color of the eyes, the hair or the sex of the child. In Europe, the European Sperm-Bank promises its customers to find the
         “ideal” donor according to his personality, his physical characteristics…

        In a century, life expectancy has doubled thanks to the drop in infant mortality, the decline in adult mortality and the fight against infections 
        and cardiovascular diseases! On average, life expectancy is 73 years worldwide. The longevity record is held by a Frenchwoman, Jeanne Calment, who died in 
        1997 at the age of 122! There are more and more centenarians, mainly in developed countries.Indeed, the disparities are strong depending on the country: with 
        an average of 55 years, Sierra Leone has the shortest life expectancy in the world.
